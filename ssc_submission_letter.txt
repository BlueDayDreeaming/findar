Dear Professor Christopher F. Baum,

We are writing to request the distribution of our new Stata package "findar" 
through the Boston College Statistical Software Components (SSC) archive.

PACKAGE INFORMATION:
====================

Package Name: findar
Version: 1.1.5
Release Date: December 16, 2025
License: MIT
Stata Version Required: 16.0 or later
Platforms: Windows and macOS

DESCRIPTION:
============

findar is a Stata package that seamlessly integrates arXiv paper search 
with automatic GitHub repository discovery. Users can search for academic 
papers on arXiv and automatically locate associated GitHub repositories 
containing code implementations.

Key Features:
- Query academic papers from arXiv.org by keywords
- Automatically extract and search for GitHub repositories from paper metadata
- Display papers with star counts and repository information
- Export results as Stata datasets for further analysis
- Support for multiple search options (maxresults, detail, abstract, etc.)

REPOSITORY:
===========

GitHub: https://github.com/BlueDayDreeaming/findar

INSTALLATION:
=============

Once approved, users can install the package using:
net install findar, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueDayDreeaming/findar/main/")

Or through SSC:
ssc install findar

USAGE EXAMPLE:
==============

Basic search:
    findar machine learning

Search with options:
    findar deep learning, maxresults(10) detail abstract

Search without GitHub integration:
    findar neural networks, nogithub

Save results to dataset:
    findar reinforcement learning, maxresults(5) save

INCLUDED FILES:
===============

- findar.ado (Main program file)
- findar.sthlp (Help file with examples and documentation)
- findar_example.do (Example script demonstrating usage)
- README.md (Package documentation)
- LICENSE (MIT License)

REQUIREMENTS:
=============

- Stata 16.0 or later
- Windows or macOS system
- Internet connection for arXiv and GitHub API access

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
====================

The package uses Stata's native copy command to query:
- arXiv API: https://export.arxiv.org/api/query
- GitHub API: https://api.github.com

No additional dependencies or external software required.

We believe findar will be a valuable addition to the SSC archive, providing 
researchers with an efficient tool to discover both academic papers and their 
related code repositories.

We have thoroughly tested the package across different systems and use cases. 
All files are ready for distribution.

Please let us know if you require any additional information or modifications 
before inclusion in the SSC archive.

Thank you for considering our submission.

Sincerely,

Chucheng Wan
