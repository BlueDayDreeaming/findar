Dear Professor Baum,

We are pleased to submit our Stata package "findar" for consideration in the 
Boston College Statistical Software Components (SSC) archive.

findar is designed to help researchers discover academic papers on arXiv and 
automatically locate their associated GitHub repositories. With a single 
command, users can search for papers by keywords and immediately see which 
ones have publicly available code implementations, along with repository 
statistics such as star counts and programming languages used.

The package supports both a simplified syntax for quick searches (e.g., 
"findar machine learning") and a standard syntax with full options for more 
refined queries. Results can be displayed in the console or saved as Stata 
datasets for further analysis.

Key features include:
  - Keyword-based search of arXiv papers
  - Automatic extraction of GitHub links from paper metadata
  - Display of repository star counts and languages
  - Export functionality to Stata datasets
  - Clickable links to papers, PDFs, DOIs, and repositories

The package requires Stata 16.0 or later and runs on Windows and macOS 
systems. It uses only Stata's native commands to access the arXiv and GitHub 
APIs, with no external dependencies.

Attached is a .zip file (findar_ssc.zip) containing the following files:
  - findar.ado (main program, version 1.1.5)
  - findar.sthlp (help documentation)

We have thoroughly tested the package and believe it would be a valuable 
addition to the SSC archive. Please let us know if you require any 
modifications or additional information.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
